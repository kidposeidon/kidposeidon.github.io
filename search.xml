      <title>My First Blog: The Palo Alto Short Story Contest</title>
      <link href="/2018/04/20/post1/"/>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  I just started working on a short story for the Palo Alto Short Story<br>contest. I am updating the story on Wattpad under my editor, Wetflame. It’s<br>a story about a girl, Delphine, who is sick with a disease called Fucosidosis<br>and her struggles as she tries to get better, find friends and undergo surgery.<br>We are currently still editing it but we hope to place in the the top three<br>in the contest. The maximum amount of words is 2,500 and it’s due April 6th.<br>If you want the link to join the Short Story competition, it is at<br><a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/short_story/entry.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.paloaltoonline.com/short_story/entry.php</a>. If you don’t life<br>near here, then hopefully you can try to join another contest in your area!</p><p>-Taylor<br>March 18, 2018</p><p>More info: <a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/short_story/entry.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.paloaltoonline.com/short_story/entry.php</a></p>]]></content>

      <title>My Second Blog: Ski Trip!</title>
      <link href="/2018/04/20/post2/"/>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  Me, my father, and my sister are currently planning on going on a ski trip!<br>Our plan is that we are going to stay in Truckee over night and then go up<br>to the resort and ski. This is preparation for Utah, which is where we are<br>going for spring break to see our friends. Since our friends have been up<br>there for awhile and they already know how to ski very well, we are practicing<br>so we can ski with them. I’ve been wanting to learn how to snowboard and might<br>try and take lessons when we go to Utah.</p><p>-Taylor</p>]]></content>

      <title>My Third Blog: Soccer Tournament!</title>
      <link href="/2018/04/20/post3/"/>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  Over the weekend, I was invited to play for the 05G Blue team. (This stands<br>  for girls born in 2005 blue team, which is the best team). I’m currently an<br>  06, but I found that despite the difference between our ages it was an<br>  amazing experience! Our first game was against Hollister, which we won 1-0!<br>  I had a great time playing left/right winger and forward. I tried out new<br>  moves and discovered some new skills and had a great time playing! Our second<br>  game was against Elite, from Newark. I had another great game and enjoyed it<br>  greatly. We won 3-0. Our third game took place against Mount Diablo. I had<br>  an AMAZING game. I played left wing most of the time and did some great moves<br>  and tricks. The one that I was most proud of was a reverse meg pass. We tied<br>  the game 2-2, but we went on to the finals where we played them again. We won<br>  in a heated game, 2-1, and I enjoyed playing and had a great time. All the<br>  girls on the team were extremely welcoming and friendly, even though I was<br>  a guest player and had never met them before, and they were extremely fun<br>  and great to be around! I hope that I can play with them again!</p><p>-Taylor</p><p>Reverse-Meg video: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BgzLRvonOiq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.instagram.com/p/BgzLRvonOiq/</a></p>]]></content>

      <title>My Fourth Blog: Why is Cobalt used in batteries?</title>
      <link href="/2018/04/20/post4/"/>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  Cobalt’s function is to provide the battery with a good cycling ability,<br>because of its tight molecular structure that it has in the cathode.<br>Nickel is being more commonly used throughout the world because of a shortage<br>on cobalt. The common belief is that the more nickel is used in a cathode,<br>the more energy that cathode will have. However, this is not true. The more<br>nickel is used in the cathode, the overall voltage decreases. Many researchers<br>are trying to find a cathode with zero cobalt composition, but cobalt must<br>be used to counteract the effects of nickel.</p><p>  Many batteries are using a “333” composition. This represents 1/3 nickel, 1/3<br>  cobalt, and 1/3 manganese. The industry is trying to optimize safety, power,<br>   performance and price by moving towards compositions like 523, 622, &amp; 811.<br>(The first digit representing nickel, second cobalt, and third as<br> manganese.) The furthest scientists have gotten is at least 10% cobalt, which<br> means that it is still required but less is needed, hopefully improving the<br> world’s amount of cobalt.</p><p>More about Cobalt:</p><p>Group:    9 –    Melting point:    1495°C, 2723°F, 1768 K<br>Period:    4 –    Boiling point:    2927°C, 5301°F, 3200 K<br>Block:     d –    Density: (g cm−3)    8.86<br>Atomic number:    27 –    Relative atomic mass:    58.933<br>State at 20°C:    Solid –    Key isotopes:    59Co<br>Electron configuration:    [Ar] 3d74s2 – CAS number:    7440-48-4</p><p>Other uses:</p><p>Cobalt, like iron, can be magnetized and so is used to make magnets.<br>It is alloyed with aluminum and nickel to make particularly powerful magnets.</p><p>Other alloys of cobalt are used in jet turbines and gas turbine generators,<br> where high-temperature strength is important.</p><p>Cobalt metal is sometimes used in electroplating because of its<br> appearance, hardness and resistance to corrosion.</p><p>Cobalt salts have been used for centuries to produce brilliant blue colors<br>in paint, porcelain, glass, pottery and enamels.</p><p>Radioactive cobalt-60 is used to treat cancer and, in some countries,<br> to irradiate food to preserve it.</p><p>Similar to this:<br><a href="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/06/post5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:4000/2018/04/06/post5/</a></p><p>-Taylor</p>]]></content>

      <title>My Fifth Blog: How Do Lithium-Ion Batteries Work?</title>
      <link href="/2018/04/20/post5/"/>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like any other battery, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery is made of one or<br>more power-generating compartments called cells. Each cell has<br>three key components: a positive electrode (connected to the battery’s<br>positive terminal), a negative electrode (connected to the negative terminal),<br>and an electrolyte between them.</p><p>Newer batteries typically contain lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4). The negative<br> electrode is generally made from graphite and the electrolyte varies<br> from one battery type to another.</p><p>All lithium-ion batteries typically work in the same way. When the battery is<br>charging up, the lithium-cobalt oxide (the positive electrode) gives up some of its<br>lithium ions, which move through the electrolyte to the negative, graphite<br>electrode and remain there. The battery absorbs and stores energy during this<br>process. When the battery is discharging, the lithium ions move back across the<br>electrolyte to the positive electrode, producing the energy that powers the<br>battery. In both cases, electrons flow in the opposite direction to the ions<br>around the outer circuit. Electrons do not flow through the electrolyte:<br>it’s effectively an insulating barrier.</p><p>The movement of ions (through the electrolyte) and electrons<br>(around the external circuit, in the opposite direction) are interconnected<br>processes, and if either stops so does the other. If ions stop moving through<br>the electrolyte because the battery completely discharges, electrons can’t move<br>through the outer circuit either, the battery will stop powering whatever you’re<br>using it for. Similarly, if you switch off whatever the battery is powering, the<br> flow of electrons stops and so does the flow of ions. The battery essentially<br> stops discharging at a high rate (it does keep on discharging,<br>  at a very slow rate, even with the appliance disconnected).</p><p>Unlike simpler batteries, lithium-ion ones have built in electronic controllers<br>that regulate how they charge and discharge. They prevent the overcharging and<br>overheating that can cause lithium-ion batteries to explode in some circumstances.</p><p>-Taylor</p>]]></content>
